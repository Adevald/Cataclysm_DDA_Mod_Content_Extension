# Mutation-Changes-Mod-Fix-
Its basically Mutation Changes Mod from Peeved Penguin but fixed, so it can run without problems in the newer versions. I Don't intend to steal anyone's project and will remove the link if the author wish it so. Also this is the first thing i have modded for cataclysm and i did it with the best intentions so... Please dun' kill me... :(

-Ok also something you need to be aware is that... In order to get the chimerical protection mutation, you will have to mod your the json files of your cataclysm to make it so, that all the fur/feathers/scale mutations not cancel between themselves out (and it isn't so ilogical if you see it, because mother nature is veeeeery weird so if the conditions are right the life can develop strange thing to cope up with the situations presented, either developing fin wings in water or both scales and feathers in the prehistory.) its not so hard if you use the search/replace commands. Reply me in the discourse to share your opinions and suggestions,or if you want me to change something or keep the mod updated. ;)
