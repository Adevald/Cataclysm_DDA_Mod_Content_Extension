Expansion mod for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead

*WARNING*!!!: This mod requires the experimental builds for it to work.

This is the gigantic jabberwock of a mod that adds a lot of content to the game. It adds new items, buildings, scenarios, monsters, etc. It also reworks and adds alternatives to many things from recipes to scenarios. It also adds a pseudo-story and lore on the works.

The **Bio-Weapon**, **Super Soldier**, **Commandeers**, **Slave Fighters** and the **Old World Prepper** NPC factions join the world.

Seek the Bio-weapons, find loot, take down news monsters and invest in skills for new craftable items.

Good luck, Survivor!

FAQ:

-What do I do with the patches?
*Unzip the the files in the zip of the name of the mod you use and leave them there. No need to delete the zip file as long as the files inside are in the folder too.

-"The zombie super scout (insert event where it killed your char)!"
*All of the super soldiers were recently rebalanced as shown here: https://github.com/Noctifer-de-Mortem/nocts_cata_mod/pull/57


-Why do you have books that level you up from 0-10? Isnt' that a bit broken?
