https://discourse.cataclysmdda.org - CDDA official forums

  *This README.txt is my changelog, so what is done will be recorded and released depending on accumulated progress.



	=>CURRENT UPDATES<= (#changes, +contents, ~rebalances, -fixes)
	
--> V1.6 - Currently, the plan is to add more miscellaneous zombies to complete both early and mid-game zed bestiary. I may provide a subtle lore later on... <--

#  REWORKS ON TILESET (frequent, or whenever I can)
#  REMOVED LUA VERSION (we have spells and it's meant to replace the LUA attacks)

#+ CHAOS ZEDS REWORKED (jolt, fake zombie, uruxis, fleshmonger. Known as zed mutants now)

+  VECTOR IMPROVEMENTS (infection of organic terrains, haze infects the creatures)
+  ZED MUTANTS (dissonant screamer, clinger, nocturne)


	=>PAST UPDATES<=

--> v1.5 - Focused on expanding the monster bestiary, especially the wandering monsters. Magic spells were composed to suit every monster's prowess, and thanks to KorGgenT, it served as an alternative to LUA attacks. <--

#  REMOVED LUA DEPENDENT STUFF (chaos zeds, special attacks and some places were removed)

#+ MAGIC OVERHAUL (unique spells for monsters to cast)

+  GUNS (7 rare, milspec guns)
+  UNIFIER, LYING BODY (final upgrade path)
+  WANDERING ABERRATIONS (flesh weaver, maneater)
+  ZED MUTANTS (nautilus, stray - nature, corrosive)
+  UNKNOWN MONSTER (looms in the wilderness, a secret, wandering passage of the galactic horrors)
+  UNKNOWN RACES (carrions, vectors)

+~ LICKER (final upgrade path, stats tweaked)

-  FIXED MONSTER SPAWNGROUPS (used to be the full list of monstergroups from CDDA)



--> v1.4 - Focused on recreating the main location of the mod, making it bigger, loot-worthy and more alive with unique dwellers inside. Also introduced the flesh cavern - a hive for crimson horrors <--

+  FAILED SPECIMEN (squirtler)
+  BOW CREATURES (kaxix, axxuros, exios, drexx and epixo)
+  FLESH CAVERN (disgusting patch of earthen filth. Home for the baneful flesh)
+  FLESH CREATURES (nearly finite gorey walls and a bunch of cloned creatures)

+~ MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS ON SECRONOM LAB (new mapgens, reworks and fixes on the structure)

-  FAILED SPECIMENS (name based on appearance, instead of incoherent numbers)



--> v1.3 - Focused on expanding the city zed bestiary by adding the final upgrade counterparts and the last 3 LUA-based monsters. <--

+  CHAOS ZEDS (fleshmonger, faux, uruxis)
+  INSECTOID MUTANT (worm)

+~ LICKER (new upgrade path, stats tweaked)
+~ MOUTH, SCOURGE (new and final upgrade paths, stats tweaked)
+~ TENDRILS (new and final upgrade path, stats tweaked, abilities reworked)

-  CHAOS SPAWNRATE (lowered spawn chance)



--> v1.2 - Focused on formulating and creating the LUA-based monsters that cycles throughout the update, with mild introduction of the main location. Also removed some zeds, for they are too nonsensical. <--

#  LUA SPECIAL ATTACKS (LUA dependent attack mechanics)

+  CITY ZED MUTANTS (lying body, scourge)
+  CHAOS ZEDS (zoid, vex, jinx, fake zombie and jolt)
+  A WANDERING ABERRATION (ayenel)
+  SECRONOM DRAGON (confined boss)
+  SECRONOM LAB (aesthetic building, outline for an even larger lab)

~  TITAN (stats and abilities reworked)
~  SWARMERS (removed and separated some specials)
~  TRANSLUCENT (removed an upgrade path)



--> v1.1 and below - Main idea posted on the forums. <--

+ INTRODUCED SECRONOM CREATURES (earlier versions of city zeds, lab mutants used to spawn in science labs)
