# Secronom: A Modification File for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead

Its mod thread is at the [official forums](https://discourse.cataclysmdda.org/t/secronom-zombies-mod-thread/16211/1).

Mod made from various references, mixed up with random spices! If you're up for an action-packed playthrough or just loves beating zeds, activate this mod and see how they take you down instead!

- This mod will only work with the latest experimental of CDDA. Update your client before using this.
- This mod is WIP. Some new contents need rebalances and fixes, but expect no fatal crashes to occur.
- Remember that CDDA is an open source game, so does this mod. Suggestions are welcome!

## Zombies
The secronom's main feature - the zeds. They range from weak up to strong variety of them.

* There are 63 zombies in total: 44 city zeds, 9 zed mutants and 10 lab zombies. Only the zombies that spawn individually are counted, while minions and other special zeds aren't.

The evolution sheet is outdated and it is taken down until a new one is created. And due to a technical problem, I can't make monster sprites for the new creatures...

Extraterrestrial creatures from uncharted worlds.

Coded for fun!

* **Secronom Dragon** **=** - Its enormous body paired with specialized armor platings makes it a formidable foe, with large weaponry system installed to bring wrath on its target.

# Monster Roles
All monsters aren't designed to kill the target, and thus providing roles to them is a must (imo). I categorized their type as:

* (**!**) *Aggro* - monsters that focuses on dealing damage. Some have their own abilities to inflict status modifiers on targets, or just to deal even more damage.

* (**+**) *Support* - monsters that are sometimes weak and feeble, but takes the chance to provide benefits for its team, such as stunning enemy targets and healing allies.

* (**~**) *Summoner* - monsters that takes advantage on creating/sending minions. Minions are usually weak, time limited and deals lesser damage, yet a hassle due to them having debuff inflicting abilities.

* (**=**) *Boss* - monsters that are versatile in every situation. Unique and those who opposes extreme danger are considered with this type.

Few are hybrids, but are still categorized into a type.
