    "description": "Developed by Leadworks as a companion sidearm to the L523 modular system, this massive autorevolver fires the powerful .223 round, but suffers high recoil as a result.  It has a weighted barrel to make recoil more manageable and a 5-chamber cylinder. This one has been modified and can accept aftermarket modifications at the cost of a broken warranty.",
