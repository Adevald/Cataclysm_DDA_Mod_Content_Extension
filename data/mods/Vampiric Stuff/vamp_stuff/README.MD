# Vampiric Stuff: A modification file for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead

Its [mod thread](https://discourse.cataclysmdda.org/t/vampiric-stuffs-mod-thread/16001/1) is at the official CDDA forums

This is the mod I've made a long time ago when I was a mobile CDDA player. It provides mild RPG feeling to the players by partaking a bunch of questlines for simple rewards.

- This mod will only work with the latest experimental of CDDA. Update your client before using this.
- This mod is WIP and fatal crashes may occur... In very rare occasions.
- For balancing purposes, do not activate *Stats Through Kills* mod. (if you did, have !!FUN!! getting OP)
- Turning *Static NPC* on before world creation is recommended.

## Items
Certain items are obtainable by exploring the world, while some are crafted only. Listed below are the items that *could* be obtained in many areas.

##### Books
These are the books or pages that could be found in certain locations. All of them requires you to have a skill level of 8 to read and learn their crafting recipes.
* *Red Velvets - The Dark Fashion*, the book that holds recipes of blood armors and clothings.
* *Glorious Gunnery*, holds renewable ammunition recipes for the vampiric guns.
* *The Vampiric Infusion*, a book that allows you to perform bloodcrafts.
* *Gravedigger's note*, a piece of paper with different recipes of weaponry.

##### Armour

##### Weapons
A set of higher degree weaponry, boasts in overall performance.

##### Ammunition
Ammunition that are fed to the vampiric guns.
* *pressurized blood*, an artificially improved blood and versatile ammo.
* *traversed blood*, a combination of regular blood and tainted ones.

_Other items remain a secret, giving you the chance to look for them by yourself :)_

## Monsters
When wandering around, you'll always encounter various monsters that are often deadly and lethal. They sometimes drop quest related items or could also be collected for something else.

##### Leeches
* *Leeches* are monsters seen mostly in moist areas like the swamps. They gradually mutate to gain more ability.
* It is the largest faction of the mod.

##### Elder Zombies
* *Elder zombies* are the rare undeads, risen from long forgotten graves.

##### Vampire Bats
* *Vampire bats* are vermins of the night, skimming their vicinity for available prey
* They are agile and are always grouped in packs.

##### Infected Vampires
* *Infected Vampires* retain their destructive nature after they succumb.
* It is the most dangerous faction of the mod.

## Locations
To prevent further spoilers, the informations in this section were briefly explained.

##### Crypt
* The crypts are found rarely in the forest, away from crowded cities.

##### Vampire Cove
* Structure that is hidden deep inside forests and serves as the sanctuary of the night creatures.

##### Wasteland Outskirts
* A large structure that acts as the refugee center for both vampires and humans.
* A nice and peaceful area with bits of similarities to faction camps.

##### Ghost Towns
* _Villages from past civilizations that were cleared out of existence._
* Rarity scales in settlement hierarchy.
* Merely an aesthetic structure on its own, nothing special.
* Also the largest pseudo-generated structure in this mod.

##### Misc
* Odd structures like random pedestals and forgotten graves.
* They usually blend in the overmap as normal terrains (forest, field, etc.) 

## NPCs
These are the friendly NPCs that interacts with you.

Vampire NPCs are beneficial for their eternal experience in combat, survival and communication skills. With wrong doings, these "skills" may test out onto you.

### Missions
Every mission is simple and self-explanatory, intended to provide players with RPG-ish feeling. Completing missions will provide features furthermore, such as unlocking new areas and obtaining useful items.

## Scenarios
Scenarios that spices up your taste in starting to venture the world. Currently a stub.

##### Vampire Wannabe
This scenario will put yourself on a test as you start being surrounded by a mob of ravenous zeds outside your LMOE shelter. Below are the listed professions for this.
* costs: 1 point - *Vampire Freak* starts with low level communication and survival skills, while the rest is similar to the evacuee profession.
* costs: 12 points - *So-called Vampire* is rather an overpowered profession in this scenario. It starts with high combat skills (mainly melee) and light survivor armor.

Starting your journey with this scenario gives you a point of direction...

## Magic Spells
Vampiric spells have mixed variety, and most of them are not suitable for the demise of a critter. There are spells that affect the target's mobility, there are spells that curses, however, few are deadly with just a simple gesture of an arm. With humans taking steps into the depths of magic, these spells were eventually discovered.

With spells being part of **Vampiric Stuff** mod, the built-in mod - **Magiclysm** - is suggested to be activated along with it. (though it wasn't listed as a dependency)

There are 3 spellcaster classes, listed descending as how aggresive the class is:
* **Warlock** - Caster that conjure spells for as long as it can. All of its spell uses mana, limited to status, but more on dealing damage. Unique prowess of a warlock is to call forth ancient idols.
* **Profane Conjurer** - Caster that conjure profane elements. Similar to warlock, it consumes large amount of mana. Most of its spell inflicts status ailments that deals damage. Unique prowess of a profane conjurer is the ability to manipulate spectacular bursts of unholy elements. It's like kelvinist, but edgy.
* **Hemomancer** - Caster that revolves on life force manipulation; more on a give-and-take type caster. Uses most of its spell with life force in inflicting both status ailments and damage, while few consumes mana. Unique prowess of a hemomancer is the ability to obtain forms.

These spellcaster types conflict with each other, i.e: learning _**Clot**_ locks you out of *Profane Conjurer* and *Warlock*, because that spell belongs to the **Hemomancer**.

Spells have tier levels. A tier level tells you how strong, efficient or rare the spell is.

# Arcane Seeker
The arcane seeker is a vampire NPC that only shows up in a certain location when you activate the *Vampiric Stuff + Arcana Mod Extension* before world creation. She will trade with you in very different manner.

## Trades
If you are a decendant of either one of the Arcana's profession (sanguinist, etc.), you have the chance to collaborate and alter your trades with the arcane seeker.

Note that you'll no longer be able to change your answer after responding to her will.

##### Collectibles
Arcana has a large library of strange objects, in which the trader exchanges with. Listed are the current items available for trading.

* *Essences*, your primary fuels to activate arcane artifacts. Usually dropped by anomalous creatures.
* *Trophies*, are the items rarely dropped by certain monster.
* *Artifacts*, are the items in which requires you to raid structures and fight its guardian.

*Price differs in difficulty of obtaining the item.*

##### Validation
The arcane seeker will tell you how much token or money will be given to you in exchange of that item. Below are the things you need to know WHEN validating an item.

* If you *Collaborated for item*, you only gain tokens as a form of currency.
* If you *Collaborated for money*, you only gain a large sum of profits.
* If you *Collaborated for nothing*, you still gain bits of money without getting any tokens.
* If you're not collaborated, you will get both lesser money and tokens.

##### Trading
Once an item is validated, you can now exchange that item for the said price.

##### Tokens
Arcane tokens are exchanged with new items, but these items depend on your days you've survived.
As of now, tokens are traded only for this mod's few selected items.
