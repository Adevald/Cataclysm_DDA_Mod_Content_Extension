This mod adds spawnable bags of dried fruits, and recipies to make them yourselves, the 2.0 version adds a recipie for slicing fruits that can be placed into a smoking rack for set and forget it drying. Blueberries, cranberries, and grapes do not need to be sliced to be added to a rack, but using this mod does remove them from the dehydrated fruit flakes output from smoking racks.
