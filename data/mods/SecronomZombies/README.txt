Secronom V1.5 - Axema Vales (author)

https://discourse.cataclysmdda.org - CDDA official website



  ~ THE VERY MAIN FOCUS OF THIS MOD IS TO MAKE YOUR WORLD MORE CHALLENGING AND INTENSE BY ADDING WHOLESOME DREADFUL CREATURES. IT ALSO ADDS FEW ASSORTED STUFF SUCH AS MAPS AND ITEMS.
  ~ MOST OF THE CREATURES CAME FROM VARIOUS REFERENCES, NOTABLY "DEAD FRONTIER". While others are miscellaneous and made-up addition, just to widen the bestiary(and interest).

  *This README.txt is my changelog, so what is done will be recorded and released depending on accumulated progress. Along with the progress of vampiric stuff mod, this mod's progress has to stop for now :(
  *AND LASTLY... PLEASE, notify me of any bugs you encountered while playing along with this mod. I'd like to hear petitions from every players who supports ^_^
  
  NOTE: Since LUA was removed in 0.D, ALL of the main features included in this mod are erased (just to comprehend with the latest builds)
  NOTE AGAIN: LUA still functions in 0.C.
