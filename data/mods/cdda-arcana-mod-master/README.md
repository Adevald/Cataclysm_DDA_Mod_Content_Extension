# Arcana and Magic Items mod for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead
Text and lore data yoinked from my old forum post for it on the CDDA forums, way back before I first PR'd it. Expect the content to be outdated, incomplete, and subject to change. :V 

This is a mod idea I cooked up a long time ago, first mentioned the idea over on the Drawing Board in the old defunct forums.

## Arcana
* A new skill, which I'm surprised I got working. It's used as the primary crafting skill for magical items. Thanks to a PR by BevapDin, magic weapons can now use this skill.

## Essence
*  Regular *essence* drops from slaying several different sorts of anomalous creatures, the more otherworldly the better. Main use is for creating most enchanted items. Certain magical items are also fueled by this.
* *Blood essence* is drained from non-anomalous beings, using anomalous means. Main use is ammo for the one magical ranged weapon available, and as a less efficient alternative to essence for crafting. Some magic weapons are fueled by this. Certain monsters, generally undead that are earthly but anomalous, also drop this instead of normal essence.
* *Dull essence* is obtained by dismantling magic items and essence using the correct tools. Used to craft and fuel certain items.

## Scenarios and Professions

##### Seeker of The Arcane
A scenario added to allow players a good way to dive right into Arcana. In it you are a visitor to one of the forgotten locations where practitioners of the arcane once lived. Each has an assortment of items, monsters, a powerful enemy at the end, and a unique item to be retrieved.

* The *Apprentice* is a mere baseline class used as something with no special talents or point costs, but still starts with a bare minimum to get into the first level of arcana.

* The *Alchemist*, *Scribe*, and *Summoner* are mainly utility professions, designed to easily get into the basics of their chosen craft. None of them are especially combat-ready, though the summoner stands a reasonable chance with its initial stock of minions.

* The *Blood Mage*, *Mage Hunter*, and *Dark Priest* each are a remnant of a given group, and each has come relatively prepared for battle. One of the __Sanguine Order__, one of the __Cleansing Flame__, and one of the __Keepers of The Oath__.

##### Urban Awakening
The second scenario added, allowing players another method of getting into the arcane, in more urban scenario. It allows an assortment of professions in the game already, Apprentice, and a few professions.

* The *Arcane Researcher* stole away with a small collection of arcane books, with nothing else but the clothes on their back.

* The *Sanguine Shrike* is a leftover member of the __Sanguine Order__, serving a different role compared to the *Blood Mage* from Seeker of The Arcane.

* The *Arcane Purifier* represents a splinter faction among the __Cleansing Flame__, combining technology and a few basic arcane tools of the trade.


## Item Dismantling

* The *Hammer of the Hunter* is needed to dismantle most arcane items. Some unique items are even more complex and difficult to get rid of, while a few are simpler to dispose of.

* *Cleansing Flame* items can be taken apart for *blood essence* using the tools of the __Sanguine Order__.


## Monster Tweaks
* A wide range of monsters have been edited to allow obtaining essence or blood essence. A few can also drop magic items.
* In addition, certain monsters will drop various small odds and ends usable in crafting magic items. These are relatively non-magic leftovers with a touch of the otherworldly to them, and hold the path to obtaining skill in the arcane without access to the work of those who came before.

## Books
##### Apprentice's Notes
* Entry-level 0-to-1 skillbook. Implied to discuss magical concepts using religious metaphors. Can additionally be used to get an earlier grasp on the few recipes that are autolearned.

##### History of Alchemy
* For crafting potions, and for getting from levels 0 to 3. A madman's interpretation of old alchemical texts, with results that would be profoundly useless without magical essence. You get a cookie if you notice the references to historical alchemical concepts, hidden underneath the stranger things the recipes involve.

##### The Six Pillars 
* Levels 2-5, requires a decent intellect to understand. Used to craft disposable magic scrolls. Conceals magic lessons behind myths concerning a pantheon of otherworldly gods.

##### Sanguine Codex
* Blood magic, for levels 3-6. Allows crafting the silver athame, and producing blood essence. Second option is for extracting blood essence from a used chalice.

##### The Cleansing Flame 
* Levels 4-7. Religious book, written by an order of witch-hunters, it allows crafting a select number of sanctioned items fueled by dull essence.

##### Oaths to the Chalice 
* Also a religious book, skill levels 5-8. Allows crafting the offering chalice, recipes for sacrificing items to obtain essence, and magic items related to __The Keepers of The Oath__. Also needed to extract blood essence from a used chalice.

##### To Master the Unknown 
* Levels 6-10. A book for summoning your very own pet monstrosities.

##### A Story in Shadow 
* Levels 8-10. Relatively rare book that combines some of the concepts from the three major factions. Translation: a few magic items with an assortment of useful effects.

##### Strange Map 
* Technically not a book but instead a mapping item, revealing most anomalous locations.

## Tools of The Trade

##### Offering Chalice
* Used for a few recipes from *Oaths to the Chalice*, as you could surely guess. Trying to take a swig from it is a bad idea, but needed to fulfill one path to crafting blood essence.

##### Silver Athame
* Used for a few recipes in *Sanguine Codex*. Only a mere 3 butchering quality. Still sharp enough, so don't play around with it. Or do play with it, that's exactly what the authors of the Codex want you to do.

##### Hammer of the Hunter
* Weapon of choice for magiphobes the world over. Required for uncrafting most magical items. Also can be used to blind enemies, and yourself if you aren't careful.

##### Blank scrolls
* Used to craft magic scrolls, obviously. With other books, certain other things can be crafted with them.

##### Silver Glyph
* On its own it's merely a shiny piece of silver. But with the right magic, quite a few monsters will be yours to command.

## Major Items

##### Sanguine Codex
* Can teach the reader to create items linked to the __Sanguine Order__. Aside from the athame itself this can include a *Hellfire Stave* that shoots fire, the *Veinreaver* as an explosive weapon, the *Revenant Crown* that protects against poisons and other effects, or *Wyrmskin Armor* capable of conjuring sprays of acid.

##### The Cleansing Flame
* This book focuses on the items used by the mage-hunting order of the same name. While the hammer itself is both a weapon and tool, there's also the *Incorruptible Sword* that can bring fire to enemies in close combat, the *Wraithslayer Crossbow* with potent bolts of piercing light, the *Gilded Aegis* for healing, or the *Mask of Insight* to gain clairvoyance and protection from the hammer's blinding flare.

##### Oaths to The Chalice 
* Focuses on the items associated with The __Keepers of The Oath__, in addition to its uses for the chalice itself. Items include the lightning-shooting *Symbol of Judgement*, invisibility-granting *Mantle of Shadows*, the *Spear of Pestilence* which can conjure a host of mutated vermin, and *Thunder Gauntlets* that let you conjure lightning.

## Magical Items
* Certain monsters drop specific items, as mentioned above. Initially the only use for them is to carve and craft these things into decorate items. While not very useful in and of themselves, working with trophies taken from the __Beyond__ can enlighten those with no formal arcane skill.
* With the base items themselves and a little arcana skill, magic seals can be crafted. These entail a little essence and some extra effort put in preparing the item, turning it into essentially a single-use spell. For all the items usable, each has a specific effect thematically linked to it.
* At higher levels, and with the right books, magic seals can be woven into an effect bound to a scroll, allowing the user a shot at learning the corresponding ability permanently. Doing so doesn't always succeed.

## Artifacts
* Certain locations offer unique items that are otherwise uncraftable. Most notably are those hidden away in the forgotten halls of arcanist groups, how have since succumbed to the cataclysm and its horrors. Two of them tie into the background of what led to their downfall, while two are tied to the monsters that infest the place.
* In addition, hidden away one can find a few other lesser artifacts, each having their own potential uses.
* Two notable unique artifacts can be crafted, leading towards what's effectively endgame content, unlocking ways to become something more than human. By obtaining an item hidden away in a temple over the sky, one can restore its true nature and gain its power. The second meanwhile entails a shrine surrounded by water, and finising what the *Sanguine Order* started.

## Other Magic Items
* Using *History of Alchemy* an assortment of potions can be made, a mimicry of the Opus Magnum. Each step has its own use however, from numbing pain to enhancing strength.
* Scrolls with an array of magical effects can be made using *The Six Pillars*. Each has a specific effect, though many are a double-edged sword in some way.
* *To Master The Unknown* allows binding summoning magic into silver glyphs, to summon an assortment of monsters of various strengths. Beware the consequences of the summoning attempt failing, though.
* With *A Story in Shadow* a few extra items are available. The *Druidic Stave* can be used to mend a selection of materials, including some that are otherwise not repairable. The *Orb of the Veil* is a tool that can enhance the mind and scry the surrounding terrain, while the *Satchel of Eternity* harnesses the power of the __Beyond__ for more mundane utility.

## Furniture
* An upright sword, currently serves as an easily-removed barrier and a Dwarf Fortress reference.
* The *Candle of Warding*, also serves as a barrier from the unholy when activated, which can be crafted.

## Misc
* *Meditate* has been given an ``item_action`` definition due to the religious items with additional uses.
* Added some overrides to make new monsters mutually friendly to both factions of monster that spawn in its area.



# **Here there be spoilers.**



## The Structures and their artifacts:

##### Strange Grove
*Before the major factions of arcanists had gained the power they held as the Cataclysm loomed closer, there were the patient scholars of the Beyond. They used little more than glimpses through the cracks of the Veil, and slowly advanced their studies. Then one day, they were scattered to the four winds. The decaying, overgrown structure has left little evidence of what caused their downfall, and the monsters that infest it may well be the work of the instability the Cataclysm itself has caused. But the knowledge they brought with them allowed the other orders to flourish, and began the conflicts that would rage in the shadow of the imminent apocalypse.*

##### Peculiar Shrine
*This was the sanctum of the Sanguine Order, where their most morbid rituals were practiced. There they sought the blood of humans, monsters, anything they could exploit to gain greater power and mastery over the arcane. Sometime before the cataclysm, they prepared their greatest ritual yet. They hunted for copies of a Summoner's Tome, comparing differences and gleaning info. They also stole away a sacred ring from some forgotten craftsman, forced to use it even though they shun service to any God or Demon. With it, they called upon a creature of great power from beyond the realms, to best it and use its power for their own. When it came through the portal, it was twisted and warped. An undead mockery of what they sought, it broke the back of the Sanguine Order by fire and claw.*

##### Impact Site
*A place sacred to The Keepers of The Oath. Over the crater of a meteor strike from long before the Cataclysm, they built a temple that floated, unbound by the rules of reality or earthy architecture. A few months before the Cataclysm, a ritual was prepared. What they needed was a blade sacred to their Order, the only surviving examples lost to various misfortunes. A few cultists of the Sanguine Order brought them the only ritual blade known to still be intact. But it was an act of sabotage, a concealed curse meant to destroy the Keepers so that the dwindling blood mages could claim a new home. It worked too well, as the monster called forth instead of their master proved too powerful, and its evil too disruptive to cleanse.*

##### Curious Structure
*This was once a sanctum of The Cleansing Flame, outwardly designed to resemble a church hidden away, far from civilization. On the very day of the Cataclysm, the lowermost level was engulfed in the fires of Hell. There came a living demon and a host of monsters from beyond, and those who survived the initial chaos were driven back and picked off. In its wake it lingered, drawing more abominations with it, and left an unearthly weapon there as a symbol of its conquest. Only the actions of the last few survivors allowed them to seal off the entrance to the lowermost levels.*

##### Basements
*Not all of the arcanists lurked in the shadows far from civilization. They still needed some means to ensure that their actions could be carried out unhindered, and that required people much closer to mundane life.*

##### Shrines
*Elsewhere, beyond the reach of civilization, a few places of otherworldly construction have been dragged into this world in the wake of the Cataclysm. Some retain evidence of human contact and exploitation, but most are wild and infested by otherworldly monsters.*
