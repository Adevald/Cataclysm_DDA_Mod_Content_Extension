There, our last effort to serve Him failed.  There remains a dangerous threat that broke our order, and a fallen relic.  If I could see that relic once again, tainted though it may be, I can rest in peace when my time comes.",
      "accepted": "Thank you.  My He From Beyond The Veil guide you, or failing that whatever other gods you serve.  I will tell you where to go, but I'm afraid I can't lead you there personally.  I ask that you retrieve the cursed blade and bring it here, and then I will explain further.  Beware the unholy monsters likely to still infest the temple, and ...what remain of the high priest.",
      "rejected": "I understand.  The threat that defiles the old temple is not to be underestimated.  If I felt I could make the journey, I would attempt it myself, even if I failed I could die knowing I did the right thing.  Seek my guidance if you change your mind.",
      "advice": "You will likely have to kill the abomination inhabiting the body of the temple's former high priest.  I know not what weapons he may still carry, nor what unholy power the spirit possessing him commands, but be careful and expect anything.  Most likely he will have turned our own symbol of judgement on his congregation, meaning you'll have to expect lightning magic.",

      "accepted": "Wonderful.  The way forward lies within Oaths to The Chalice.  To undertake this task is to accept the responsibility that comes with it.  I will offer what advice I can, but I can't perform the purification ritual for you.  That shall be your duty.",
      "rejected": "I understand, though I hope you have not come to favor the relic's current state for its use as a weapon.  Seek me out if you deem yourself ready.",

      "success": "To see this, after so long... it's hard for me to put words to this.  It'll never be restored to the glory it once held, forged in fires from Beyond as one of the divine gifts, but even this gives me hope.  Come, we have much to discuss, before we can continue.",

To use the awakened blade requires certain energies to be returned to The Beyond.  The method that best fulfills the relic's purpose requires you to seek out the lingering wounds in The Veil, and my fading senses have revealed one such place that may be useful.  However you choose to serve Him, your actions will serve a greater purpose.  Will you accept my guidance in this envdevour?",
      "accepted": "May He From Beyond The Veil guide us both.  I will do what I can to direct you towards letting the relic serve its purpose.  Failing that, there are methods to sustain this power, to be found within the pages of Oaths To The Chalice.  Some of what you will see are common, trifling things.  Others are wonders only He can bestow, and they may yet serve you well.  When the time comes and you have seen the fruit of your labor, speak to me again.",
      "rejected": "Unfortunate.  I am hopeful that you will heed the call on your own, and come to me when you are ready.  In pursuing the path laid before you, your destiny is intertwined with those who seek to ensure this world does not fall into further decay.  One way or another, your path lies before you.",
      "advice": "Drawing upon a rift will require you to linger beside the portal, until the blade draws upon its power.  You will know in time, when you have received the sign.  If you require what little guidance I can offer, you need only ask.",
      "inquire": "Show me that spark within your eyes, if you have earned His favor...",
      "success": "So it has come to pass.  I hope the task was not too troublesome for you, nor did His favor prove too difficult to grasp.  This proves it.  You are suitable to be His Chosen.  Come, there is much to discuss.  And then, I hope, something more to do...",

I have told you the nature of our mission, our enduring oath.  And you have filled this feeble old heart with renewed hope.  Others may foster the survival of humanity, but what good will it do if the wounds in The Veil continue to bleed, and we are cast into the abyss?  That is our purpose, the one common ground we held with the Cleansing Flame.  But every rift sealed, every intrusion halted, pulls us away from the brink.  I ask you to continue along the path you have chosen.  Continue your work, and use your rewards with care and precision.  Will you accept this request?",
      "accepted": "Thank you.  There is another such place that may be useful to start with, and I'll show you where it is.  Other than that, your journey may be a long one, hunting for instabilities and presenting these offerings from Beyond.  When you have achieved this, seek to me again if you so desire.  I will offer you what little guidance I can.",
      "rejected": "I see.  Perhaps you are confident that The Veil will hold, seeing that it hasn't collapsed despite all that has happened.  But you have come so far, and can we be certain when the consequences are so dire?  If you change your mind, I will await you.",
      "advice": "Be cautious in what methods you use to obtain the offering.  Use summoning rite only when it is a necessary infliction to make on The Veil, and do not let the allure of blood magic cause yourself undue harm.  As for other rifts to seal, remember every place that you have seen touched by the influence of the arcane, and of mundane hazards as well.  I have little experience in the laboratories that inflicted so much destruction, but they may hold remnants that can be mended.",
      "inquire": "Has He anointed you as his Chosen?",
      "success": "You have proven yourself, in ways that few have.  For each relic, only one high priest each had been anointed as you have.  I will offer whatever council I can, but I have no tasks left to offer you.  Follow as fate leads.",
