Ascension Mod for C:DDA

Readme updated 9/11/18

Thanks for downloading the mod, and even moreso for taking the time to read this, to sweeten the deal, I'll pepper this file with some tips and minor spoilers so you don't get bored and get a headstart on the mod.

This mod requires PK's Rebalance mod and the Arcana mod to load. You can find the updated github links here:

https://github.com/Siyalatas/PKs_Rebalancing (Adds a lot of dangerous monsters and locations: this fork is a personal favorite, the standard PK mod works perfectly)

https://github.com/chaosvolt/cdda-arcana-mod (Magic, arcane energies, eldritch monsters from far beyond the veil and lots of new locations, items and mechanics)

Thanks to all the creators and maintainers of these mods who have given me the opportunity to make this. It is a honor to work with you and I want to tell you that I have enjoyed all your mods immensely, I couldn't have done this without your help.

The goal of this mod is to ascend, create an altar with the new death drops of the biggest threats and faction monsters present in the game, use the new arcana skill to hallow the altar in conjunction with a diamond obelisk and create a tear in reality to cross a portal between parallel universes.

The "big three" Roguelikes have been a great influence in this mod, see if you can spot the references!

>CHANGES

Changed Hell spire arena layout and added a new level (and new loot to both!) with a new boss in a secret location. Look closely!

Edited the strange temple treasure room to give more useful items and a specific item that's vital for the end of the quest.

Edited and added some items, recipes and constructions relating to the Arcana mod and mainline endgame content.

Finally added a win condition to DDA for those survivors that already have explored everything and want to do one final quest.
