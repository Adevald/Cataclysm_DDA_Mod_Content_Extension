# Vampiric Stuff: A modification file for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead

Its [mod thread](https://discourse.cataclysmdda.org/t/vampiric-stuffs-mod-thread/16001/1) is at the official CDDA forums

This is the mod I've made a long time ago when I was a mobile CDDA player.

- Turn on static NPC, or you won't encounter any NPCs with this mod.
- This mod is WIP, means there will always be a change in this file...

## Items
Certain items are obtainable by exploring the world, while some items aren't. As listed below are the items that *could* be obtained in many areas.

##### Books
These are the books that could be found in certain locations. Most of them requires you to have a skill level of 8 to read.
* *Red Velvets - The Dark Fashion*, the book that holds recipes of blood armors and clothings.
* *Glorious Gunnery*, holds renewable ammunition recipes for the vampiric guns.
* *The Vampiric Infusion*, a book that allows you to perform bloodcrafts.
* *Gravedigger's note*, a piece of paper with different recipes of weaponry.

##### Armour
These are the improved versions of regular clothing. Some lockers and dressers in certain locations could have them.
* *bloodset*, usually worn by vampires as their main clothing.
* *blood infused set*, improved survivor armor worn by few vampires.

##### Weapons
A set of higher degree weaponry, boasts in overall performance. You could see them in weapon racks of a location.
* *blood sipper*, a large and heavily serrated sword.
* *blood diver*, an extremely light, hunting dagger.
* *hammerius*, a large hammer with retractable spikes.
* *knuckle biters*, a light weapon that allows unarmed techniques.
* *fanged falchion*, a longsword distinct to its low weight.

##### Ammunition
Ammunition that are fed to the vampiric guns. You could acquire them at some point.
* *pressurized blood*, an artificially improved blood and versatile ammo.
* *traversed blood*, a combination of regular blood and tainted ones.

_Other items remain a secret, giving you the chance to look for them by yourself :)_

## Monsters
When wandering around, you'll always encounter various monsters that are often deadly nor lethal. They sometimes drop quest related items or could also be collected for something else.

##### Leeches
* *Leeches* are usual monsters, seen mostly in moist areas like swamps.
* It is the largest faction of the mod.

##### Elder Zombies
* *Elder zombies* are the rare monsters, risen from long forgotten graves.

##### Vampire Bats
* *Vampire bats* are the vermins of the night, skimming their vicinity for available prey
* They are agile and are always grouped in packs.

## Locations
To prevent further spoilers, the information in this section is briefly explained.

##### Crypt
* The crypts are found rarely in the forest, away from crowded cities.

##### Vampire Cove
* Structure that is hidden deep inside the forest and serves as the sanctuary of the night creatures.

##### Wasteland Outskirts
* A large structure that acts as the refugee center for both vampires and humans.
* A nice and peaceful area with similarities to the faction camps.

##### Ghost Towns
* _Villages from past civilizations that were cleared out of existence._
* Rarity scales in settlement hierarchy.
* Merely an aesthetic structure on its own...
* Also the largest pseudo-generated structure in this mod.

##### Misc
* Odd structures like random pedestals, forgotten graves and blood-filled caverns.
* They usually blend in your map as normal terrains (forest, field, etc.) 

## NPCs
These are the friendly NPCs that will interact with you.

Vampire NPCs are beneficial for their eternal experience in combat, survival and communication skills. With wrong doings, these "skills" may test it out on you.

### Missions
I won't spoil the what, when and how to get the missions, but you have to **remember**:

* **Read before you pick!** Some dialogue responses will mess up your whole progress from picking the *obviously mistaken* answer, especially after completion of missions.

## Scenarios
Scenarios that spices up your taste in starting to venture the world. Currently a stub.

##### Vampire Wannabe
This scenario will put yourself on a test as you start being surrounded by a mob of ravenous zeds outside your LMOE. Below are the listed professions for this.
* costs: 1 points - *Vampire Freak* starts with a map to locate certain locations that will help you for earlier progress.
* costs: 6 points - *So-called Vampire* is rather an overpowered profession in this scenario. It starts with high combat skills (mainly melee) and survivor armor.

# Arcane Seeker
The arcane seeker is a vampire NPC that only shows up in a certain location when you have activated the *Vampiric Stuff + Arcana Mod Extension* before world creation. She will trade with you in very different manner.

## Trades
If you are a decendant of either one of the Arcana's profession (sanguinist, etc.), you have the chance to collaborate and alter your trades with the arcane seeker.

Note that you'll no longer be able to change your answer after responding to her will.

##### Collectibles
Arcana has a large library of strange objects, in which the trader exchanges with. This library is being expanded, so the listed ones below are the current items available for trading.

* *Essences*, your primary fuels to activate arcane artifacts. Usually dropped by anomalous creatures.
* *Trophies*, are the items rarely dropped by certain monster.
* *Artifacts*, are the items in which requires you to raid structures and fight its guardian. Well, some of them have.

*Price differs in difficulty of obtaining the item. Arcane books are not allowed here.*

##### Validation
The arcane seeker will tell you how much token or money will be given to you in exchange of that item. Below are the things you need to know WHEN validating an item.

* If you *Collaborated for item*, you only gain tokens as a form of currency.
* If you *Collaborated for money*, you only gain a large sum of profits.
* If you *Collaborated for nothing*, you still gain bits of money without getting any tokens.
* If you're not collaborated, you will get both lesser money and tokens.

##### Trading
Once an item is validated, you can now exchange that item for the said price.

##### Tokens
Arcane tokens are exchanged with new items, but these items depend on your days you've survived. The items to trade with you is being expanded, and I am planning to branch them in different trades. Vampiric Stuff and Arcana should have an exclusive item for this, but currently has nothing...
