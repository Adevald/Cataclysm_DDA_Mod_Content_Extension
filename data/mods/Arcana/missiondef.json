Not long before things boiled over, I've been having strange dreams of otherworldly scenery, and now that everything's gone to hell I'm wondering if there's any meaning to it.  I know it sounds crazy, but there might be something in what I recall that we could investigate.",
      "accepted": "Thank you.  Thing is, some of the scenery from these dreams looked familiar, and after zero day I started poring over some local maps to try and make sense of what little looked real.  One of the places I recall was hidden away in a part of the local woods I used to go camping in.  I doubt we'll find anything, but maybe it'll give me peace of mind knowing these weird dreams don't have anything to do with what happened.",

Looked a bit more dangerous but there might be something valuable to make up for it.  And if there's nothing there, fine by me.  Would mean those dreams are just that, and nothing meaningful.",

I saw someone traveling there, and a shadow of something otherworldly hanging over the place.  Thinking on what I recalled was calming, for some reason.  Maybe we'll find something?",

      "advice": "It was a rural house of sort sort.  Nothing dangerous or even weird stood out in that dream.  In fact it seemed like the most mundane out of the bunch, but there was this sense of foreboding, and what happened in it was so much more vivid.",

      "success": "Looks like the place.  I can see signs of the house being inhabited.  The place looks so familar even though this is the first time I've ever laid eyes on it in the waking world.  Maybe the dreams were visions of the future, if so I'm guessing that one was about traveling here, not just an omen or whatever.  I'll let you decide what to do if we meet anyone here, I don't know if the other dreams will do us much good.  At least trying to make sense of them, seeing these places in person made me feel, I don't know, better.  Less uneasy.  Thank you.",

Others are wonders only He can bestow, and they may yet serve you well.  When the time comes and you have seen the fruit of your labor, speak to me again.",

Others may foster the survival of humanity, but what good will it do if the wounds in The Veil continue to bleed, and we are cast into the abyss?  That is our purpose, the one common ground we held with the Cleansing Flame.  But every rift sealed, every intrusion halted, pulls us away from the brink.  I ask you to continue along the path you have chosen.  Continue your work, and use your rewards with care and precision.  Will you accept this request?",

I will offer you what little guidance I can.",

Use summoning rite only when it is a necessary infliction to make on The Veil, and do not let the allure of blood magic cause yourself undue harm.  As for other rifts to seal, remember every place that you have seen touched by the influence of the arcane, and of mundane hazards as well.  I have little experience in the laboratories that inflicted so much destruction, but they may hold remnants that can be mended.",
