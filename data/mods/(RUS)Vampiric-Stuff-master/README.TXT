Vampiric Stuff v1.2 - Axema Vales (author)

https://discourse.cataclysmdda.org - CDDA official website



  ~ THE MOD FOCUSES ON ADDING VAMPIRES TO YOUR WORLD, ALONG WITH THE NEW LOCATIONS TO EXPLORE, QUESTS TO COMPLETE, ITEMS TO DISCOVER AND MONSTERS TO ERADICATE!

  * The v1.2 is a progress to resurrect this old jewel, after it was abandoned for so long... But for now, fixes, tweaks and reworks are the stuff needed for this mod :)
  
  NOTE: Turn on static npcs in your world settings, or you won't see any npcs in almost all locations, as these are the main feature of this mod.

  $ The story flow is quest dependent, and actually follows this path:
  
	=> CRYPT => COVE => OUTSKIRTS => (WIP)

  $ If you've came to the outskirts even without meeting an isolated vampire first doesn't affect the gameplay at all.
