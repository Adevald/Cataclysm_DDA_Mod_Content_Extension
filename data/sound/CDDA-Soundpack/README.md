# CDDA-Soundpack

This is based on ChestHole's soundpack with some RRFSounds mixed in, but with the sounds cleaned up and some of them replaced (monster sounds, footsteps, thunder, rain, explosions etc). The music with rain embedded into them were replaced with new songs as well. This should fix the "it's raining while it's not raining bug". Covered the weapon sounds for all ranged weapons in vanilla experimental (as of May 2018). Finally this adds sound effects to the bionics that were missing and A LOT of missing smash sounds for terrain and furniture. This soundpack covers all available sounds supported by soundpacks (as of May 2018).

- Ashes of Apocalypse (dead postapoc Morrowind TC mod)
- Ground Zero (dead postapoc Doom 3 TC mod)

All the music has been carefully selected to match the overall ambient tone, with some of them being slightly different for variety, while not straying too far. Some of the music has been edited to remove parts that stood out too much. Most of the music will sound pretty bad on laptop speakers etc, so wear headphones or use proper speakers.

If you want to replace the music and use your own, you can replace the bg .ogg files. If you want to disable the music, then delete the musicset.json file and all the bg .ogg files in the music folder.
