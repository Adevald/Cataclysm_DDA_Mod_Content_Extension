This is a modpack for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead (0.D-9040 - tiles)

VK Group: https://vk.com/ganta_cdda

## Description:

This modpack intended to increase amount of content. It contains monsters, buildings, armor/weapons and some questlines. I try to keep some balance and compatibility as i can. But some balance problems can take place sometimes.
  
This modpack supports MSX++DeadPeopleEdition.


## INSTALLITION:

Folders "Config" and "Data" pull in root of the game.
