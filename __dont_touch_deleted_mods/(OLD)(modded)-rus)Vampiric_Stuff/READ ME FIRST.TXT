Axema Vales - Vampiric Stuff (WIP) V1.1

Updates every week! Go to reddit.com or cataclysmdda.org and look for the latest mod post!

I NEED HELP ABOUT TILESET!!! Generally, this mod sucks without a tileset, so I need some help (I'm not a good sprite creator, BTW)



NEWS AND UPDATES/FIXES (current version):
+NEW ARMOR SETS (blood and blood infused, recipes also included)
+A NEW MELEE WEAPON (knuckle biters)
+A WIDE RANGE OF RANGE WEAPONS AND AMMOS (blood-projecting gun types, modified human gun types)
+ADDED REINFORCED WEAPONS (blood sipper+, simple requirement)
+ADDED NEW MANDATORY LOCATIONS (blood hole, random graveyards)
+ADDED MAIN LOCATION (wasteland outskirts, a large location acts like vampire cove... Needs more work)
-ADDITIONAL ENEMY UPGRADES (blood compact zombies and leeches now has 3rd tier upgrades)
-ADDITIONAL ENEMIES (ranged base leeches)
-WEAPON TWEAKS (moderately reduced damage, removed ultimate techniques, regained after reinforcement)
-MONSTER TWEAKS (I realized that the current monsters are unfair, so I greatly reduced their stats)
-FIXED A MAP (vampire cove is now bigger and more pleasant to look at)
-MAP GEN FIXED (slightly increased the chance to see strutures)
-FIXED NPCS (they are now wearing blood armors, few got vampire guns)
-FIXED NPC STATS (greatly reduced stat)
-CHANGED VAMPIRE FACTION LORE (no more hate, they want humans to survive)

TO DO LIST (PLANNED UPDATES):
*WASTELAND NPC MISSIONS (too busy, next time they'll have it)
*TWO UPGRADE WEAPON PATH (stronger based damage or blood consumption based damage... Later on, you'll know it clearly)
*NEW STRUCTURES (large cavern arena, I think)
>STRUCTURE FIXES (wasteland outskirts would be remaked... Probably)

#REMOVED PLANS (ambitions has overtaken me from excitement):
ENEMIES: visage monster type (not a good thing to be included on the mod)
LOCATION: Vampirus (not beneficial, unless I got a reason adding it)
